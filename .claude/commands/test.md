# Run Tests

Run the test suite for the Ananagrams project.

## Instructions

1. Run the tests using npm test with CI=true to prevent watch mode
2. Report the results including:
   - Number of tests passed/failed
   - Any failing test details
   - Coverage information if available

## Command

```bash
cd /Users/mike/git/ananagrams && CI=true npm test
```

If tests fail, analyze the failures and suggest fixes.
